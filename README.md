# Employee_Empathy_Optimiser

The three main challenges with text mining for emotional tracking through Natural Language Processing are-
Statement Polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
Statement Strength
And the biggest challenge, complexity of language
The methodology is divided into three parts with sub-sections as follows-
Data Extraction
Data processing (pre-processing, emotion annotation)
Experiments (Feature extraction, Classification)
We have used R to test, train and code our API. Tableau is used for daily visualization reporting to the top management.
